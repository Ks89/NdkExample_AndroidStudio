# NdkExample in AndroidStudio
My example of an AndroidStudio1.3 RC NDK's project.

# TODO
- update this read me, because it's very old. Please read the code ;)

# What is it intereseting here?

I created an example to calculate the average between 6 and 10 and after that this app calculates the power of previous result.
I mean 6+10/2 = 8 and finally the result will be ((6+10)/2)= 8\*8 = 64.
But 6+10 was made by the native part, and 8\*8 by java.

This means that:<br>
1. Android creates an Activity and inside it calls **averageTwoNumberFromJni(6, 10)**<br>
2. **averageTwoNumberFromJni(6, 10) is a native method** that return an int<br>
3. in the c implementation of averageTwoNumberFromJni, i call the java method (in the original Activity): **private int power(int a) passing to a the result of averageTwoNumberFromJni(6, 10)**, i.e. 8<br>
4. **power(int a) calculate a\*a and returns the result to the caller method averageTwoNumberFromJni**<br>
5. **averageTwoNumberFromJni returns the result of power to the java part**<br>
6. The result appears in Logacat thanks to: Log.d(TAG, "average\*average = " + averageTwoNumberFromJni(6, 10));


Attention this project requires Android Studio RC1 or higher, gradle 2.5  or higher, and gradle build tool experimental 0.1.0 or higher.
